# Roadmap

Parity with the Scala plugin in IntelliJ IDEA is the goal. Nearly every editor feature of the plugin rests on one of
a few pieces of platform infrastructure, so the milestones are ordered by those pieces: each one, once the host
provides it, unlocks a group of features.

A feature is done when an oracle over the plugin's own test data (`scala/scala-impl/testdata` in intellij-scala)
agrees with the host, and the cases that do not agree are explained in the README, as for type inference today.

## Current state — 2026-10-31

The host already provides Scala 2/3 diagnostics, navigation, project-wide text search, symbols, folding, semantic tokens,
completion, signature help, inlay hints, selection ranges, IntelliJ/scalafmt formatting, rename, organize imports, and
previewable code actions. The documented limitations remain in [README.md](README.md#known-limitations): compiler-index
searches and Java class indexing are incomplete, some UI-dependent actions and hints are unavailable, and inspections
are not run.

**Verification checkpoint:** before the organization work, `sbt test` passed 108 tests. After the bootstrap,
resource-lifecycle, stable-module-identity, and package changes, `sbt test` passed 112/112. The final import and
threading-documentation cleanup then passed `sbt compile "Test / compile"`; those cleanup-only edits were not followed
by another test run. `sbt dist` passed, and the built distribution completed the fixture smoke journey (diagnostics,
hover, definition request, shutdown) with exit code 0. Temporary `Host_StubIndex` generation and `javac` compilation
using the exported compile classpath passed; the checked-in adapter still contains both maintained overloads.
Beta 1 remains implemented but untagged, and Beta 2 closed without inspections.

### Ownership and lifecycle constraints

- The IntelliJ application and extension area are JVM-wide. One host is created per JVM; replacing or restarting it
  requires a process restart. Multiple-project support is outside this roadmap.
- The process root owns platform state and the host library file system. It closes file systems opened for archives or
  alternate JDKs on JVM shutdown, and leaves the running JVM's shared JDK file system open.
- Each `ProjectSession` owns its BSP client connection, scalafmt instance, and document compiler. Session close waits
  for in-flight document compilations before releasing their compiler class loaders; it does not reset the process host.
- Build target IDs identify modules and their dependencies. Display names remain for presentation and may be
  ambiguous; existing `ModuleSpec` callers without an ID continue to use the name as the default ID.

### Next milestones

1. Follow the platform/plugin upgrade procedure in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#platform-and-plugin-upgrades)
   before the next dependency upgrade: use a matching platform/plugin pair, review generated adapter diffs, and run
   the adapter surface plus semantic checks for changed boundaries. The surface test is one gate, not a compatibility
   verdict on its own.
2. Decide whether inspections belong in a later milestone. They are not part of Beta 1 or Beta 2.

#### Current package ownership

- `scalapsihost.platform`: IntelliJ bootstrap, adapters, threading, files, and indexes; flat initially.
- `scalapsihost.build`: BSP, compiler, and scalafmt integration.
- `scalapsihost.workspace`: project-session and build-import lifecycle.
- `scalapsihost.language`: language operations and internal result models.
- `scalapsihost.lsp`: transport and request/response mapping.
- `scalapsihost`: root `ScalaPsiHost` facade and caller-facing `HostConfig`, `Diagnostic`, `ModuleSpec`, `HostModule`,
  `ModuleModel`, `LineColumn`, and `LibraryIndexReport` types.

The package map describes the current implementation. The historical milestones below retain their oracle counts and
limitations as recorded at the time.

## Original infrastructure sequence

- **A. Read-only, one file.** Nothing new: walk the PSI, or capture what the plugin already produces.
- **B. Project-wide search.** A word index (`IdIndex`) over the sources and a host `PsiSearchHelper`, behind the
  plugin's `referencesSearch` and `definitionsScopedSearch` extensions.
- **C. Change engine.** A change runs on a non-physical copy of the file, as the platform's intention preview does;
  the difference with the original becomes a `WorkspaceEdit`. Needs `CodeStyleManager` and the formatter, which
  almost every modification of the plugin calls.
- **D. Caret-bound features.** An `Editor` object in the fixed tables (document, caret, selection, settings and lexer;
  `AdapterSurfaceTest` shows what the plugin uses of it), a completion context (`CompletionParameters`, the copy with
  a dummy identifier), and a parameter-info UI context that records what `updateUI` renders.
- **E. Inspections.** The plugin's `LocalInspectionTool`s run without UI against a fixed profile, the IDE's default.

## Done ahead of order (2026-10-29)

The change engine and the formatter (beta 1), completion, signature help, selection ranges and the request-local
`Editor` (beta 2), and inlay hints exist; their gaps are in the README's known limitations. Next, from the review of that work:

- Scala 3 fixtures in the completion and parameter info oracles; file templates (override completion); live
  templates as snippets.

## Alpha 2 — read-only features, and the gaps of alpha 1

- The memory held per edit (`SessionBenchmark --edit-file`, about 0.3 MB per edit): locate it and let it go.
  **Done:** one `EverythingGlobalScope` per project instead of one per lookup; flat over 120 edits.
- A real Scala 2 project as an acceptance test. **Done:** korolev v1.5.0 agrees with the plugin's own project test.

## Alpha 3 — project-wide search

- Word index over the sources, `PsiSearchHelper`.
- Find references, implementations, workspace symbols. Oracle: `findUsages`.
- Java class files in the short-name index (auto-import and completion need them).
- `PackageIndex`: the plugin's use scope of a `private[pkg]` member is a `PackageScope`, which needs it (the
  inheritor searchers behind completion hit it today and log an error).

## Beta 1 — changes

Implementation completed on 2026-10-31 within the preview and search limits documented in README; the release is not
tagged. At the pre-organization checkpoint on that date, the complete suite passed 108 tests and a rebuilt distribution
formatted through scalafmt over LSP stdio. Those checks predate the current organization work. Inspections remain a
separate, undecided milestone.

- `CodeStyleManager` and the formatter; formatting, range formatting. **Done:** `FormatterOracle`: 187 agree,
  0 disagree, 0 skip. Whole-file requests honor the nearest workspace `.scalafmt.conf` through the plugin's dynamic
  engine; missing formatter artifacts are downloaded from Maven Central and cached under the host's state directory.
  Range formatting keeps the plugin's IntelliJ default. `ScalafmtOracle`: 8 agree, 0 disagree, using the plugin's
  3.11.5 and 2.7.5 contracts; the suite also verifies cold-cache download, disk-cache reuse and config failures.
- The change engine. **Done:** preview copies and minimal edits, shared by formatting, completion handlers and
  code actions; internal mod-command copies use the same synchronous commit and cleanup lifecycle.
- Code actions from the plugin's intentions and the annotators' quick fixes. **Done within the preview contract:**
  intentions, annotation fixes and surrounders return versioned LSP edits. `CodeActionsOracle` replays
  `SurroundWithTest`: 48 agree, 0 disagree, 0 skip; selected intention suites: 15 agree, 0 disagree, 12 skip.
  Type-import quick fixes offer each plugin candidate separately. Remaining: global-member/conversion imports
  and broader intention-oracle coverage. `testdata/actions` covers editor key handlers, not these intentions.
- Organize imports. **Done:** `source.organizeImports` invokes the plugin optimizer on a preview copy;
  `OptimizeImportsOracle`: 53 agree, 1 disagree, 7 skip, with the limits documented in README.
- Auto-import of types and rename. **Done:** type-import candidates are separate annotation quick fixes and
  completion insertions (`CompletionOracle` auto-import: 13 agree, 0 disagree). `RenameOracle`: 112 agree,
  1 disagree, 18 skip; `FindUsagesOracle`: 74 agree, 0 disagree, 3 skip. Search and preview gaps remain in README.

## Beta 2 — completion and inspections

Closed on 2026-10-30 (`v0.1.0-b2`) without inspections: their milestone is still to decide.

- The `Editor` object.
- Selection ranges. **Done:** successive Extend Selection steps through `SelectWordUtil`, the platform's base
  handlers and the plugin's descriptor-registered handlers; the editor supplies default settings and its layered lexer.
- Completion (oracles: `completion`, `completion3`, `keywordCompletion`) and signature help (oracle:
  `parameterInfo`), with a latency budget (p95 under 150 ms on the acceptance projects). **Done**, the budget
  waived: p95 261 ms first pass, 186 ms warm on YggDrasil, the remainder being the plugin's own contributors and
  weighers, a gap to the IDE judged insignificant.
- Inspections as diagnostics, with their quick fixes as code actions. Oracle: `inspections`. **Not done**; the
  quick fixes need beta 1's code actions.

## 0.1 — release

- Distribution and CI on tags.
- A platform upgrade process, with the adapter surface test as its gate.
- Third-party license listing for the binary distribution.
- Editor extensions published.

## Later

- A persistent index, for fast startup.
- `.sbt` files (sbt's meta-build is a build target over BSP).
- Call and type hierarchy.
- Test discovery and code lenses over BSP.
- Refactorings with dialogs in the IDE: extract, inline, change signature.
- Worksheets; debugging (DAP).
