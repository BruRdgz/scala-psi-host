# scala-psi-host

A Scala language server powered by the IntelliJ Scala plugin, running in a standalone process without the IntelliJ
application container. It provides editor features through the Language Server Protocol (LSP) and imports Scala 2
and Scala 3 projects through the Build Server Protocol (BSP).

The project is in beta. Integration tests use sbt builds; mixed Scala/Java projects have partial Java support.

## Features

- Diagnostics from the Scala plugin and compiler, including current-buffer compilation for Scala 3.
- Hover documentation, definitions, type definitions, references and implementations.
- Completion with automatic imports and insertion handlers, signature help and inlay hints.
- Rename, organize imports, previewable quick fixes, intentions and surround actions.
- Whole-file and range formatting with scalafmt or the IntelliJ formatter.
- Document highlights, outlines, folding, selection ranges and semantic tokens.
- Workspace symbol search and module-aware resolution.
- Navigation into library sources or decompiled class files.

## Build

Requires Git, sbt and **JDK 25** for both the build and the server.

The IntelliJ Platform version and Scala plugin revision are pinned in [build.sbt](build.sbt). From the repository
root, build the plugin in a sibling checkout, then build the host:

```sh
export JAVA_HOME=/absolute/path/to/jdk-25

git clone https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-scala ../intellij-scala
git -C ../intellij-scala checkout 491569803c6c3c2f93a0bda51490425fda237fc0
(
  cd ../intellij-scala
  sbt --java-home "$JAVA_HOME" packageArtifactZip
)

sbt --java-home "$JAVA_HOME" dist
```

The distribution is written to `target/dist/`. Its launcher is `target/dist/bin/scala-psi-host`; keep the `bin/` and
`lib/` directories together when moving it.

By default, the build reads plugin jars from `../intellij-scala/target/plugin/Scala/lib` and verifies the checkout's
revision. Set `SCALA_PLUGIN_LIB` to use another plugin build's `Scala/lib` directory. This skips the revision check;
the supplied jars must still match the host's platform dependencies.

## Usage

Your Scala project needs a BSP connection file under `.bsp/`. For sbt, run this from the project's root using the
JDK required by that build:

```sh
sbt bspConfig
```

Configure your editor's LSP client to launch the distribution's `bin/scala-psi-host` over stdio, with `JAVA_HOME`
pointing to JDK 25. The server currently uses one workspace root and expects one BSP connection file.

A VS Code client is included in [editors/vscode](editors/vscode). Its configuration is:

```json
{
  "scalaPsiHost.serverPath": "/absolute/path/to/scala-psi-host/target/dist/bin/scala-psi-host",
  "scalaPsiHost.javaHome": "/absolute/path/to/jdk-25"
}
```

The extension reports import progress and server readiness in the status bar. Its **Show Status** and **Show Log
File** commands provide troubleshooting information. Set `scalaPsiHost.debugLog` to `true` before starting the
server for request timing logs.

Completion follow-up edits require client support for `workspace/applyEdit`; caret placement also requires
`window/showDocument`.

## Configuration

| Environment variable | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `JAVA_HOME` | JDK used to run the server | `java` on `PATH` |
| `SCALA_PSI_HOST_STATE` | State, logs, formatter cache and library source files | `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/scala-psi-host`, or `~/.cache/scala-psi-host` |
| `SCALA_PSI_HOST_HEAP` | Maximum JVM heap | `2g` |
| `SCALA_PSI_HOST_LOG` | Set to `debug` to log every request's timing | Informational logging |

Logs are sent to the editor and written under `<state-dir>/logs/`. The latest ten log files are retained.

Whole-file formatting uses the nearest `.scalafmt.conf` between the source file and workspace root. The configuration
must declare a formatter version; missing dependencies are downloaded from Maven Central and cached locally.
Project exclusion filters apply. Without a config, and for range requests, the IntelliJ formatter is used.

When the client supports dynamic file watchers, changes to sbt build definitions and source-file creation or deletion
trigger a reimport. Unsaved source text is preserved.

## Known limitations

- References and implementations use text-based searches without compiler indexes. Implicit/SAM usages and Java
  inheritors can be missed. Rename can leave Java overrides unchanged.
- Java binary short-name lookup is incomplete, workspace symbols list Scala declarations only, and JDK symbols come
  from the JDK running the server.
- Inspections, dialog-dependent actions, file/package moves and optional automatic renames are unsupported.
  Code actions are limited to current-file text previews.
- Some completion contributors require IDE services that are unavailable. Live templates have no snippet tab stops;
  completion followed by handler edits takes two undo steps.
- Inlay hints are text labels without the IDE's interactive presentation or range hints. Project IDE code-style
  settings are not imported, and range formatting uses the IntelliJ formatter even when scalafmt is configured.
- One workspace is served per process. Shared sources assigned to multiple BSP targets are rejected as ambiguous;
  `.sbt` build-definition files are not treated as editable Scala sources.
- Indexes are in memory. Initial imports and checks can be expensive; document requests run in order, so an import
  or slow request can delay later requests.
- A reimport failure before host updates preserves the previous snapshot. A failure after updates begin requires
  restarting the server.

## Development

Generate the fixture's BSP connection once, then run the tests from the repository root:

```sh
(
  cd fixtures/bsp-project
  sbt --java-home "$JAVA_HOME" bspConfig
)
sbt --java-home "$JAVA_HOME" test
```

The suite covers PSI semantics, module resolution, editing, BSP imports, formatting, LSP requests and the reviewed
platform-adapter surface. Additional tools in [src/test/scala/scalapsihost/oracle](src/test/scala/scalapsihost/oracle)
compare selected upstream plugin fixtures; their source files document the supported inputs.

To check a built distribution over stdio with Python 3:

```sh
python3 dist/smoke-test.py \
  target/dist/bin/scala-psi-host \
  fixtures/bsp-project \
  fixtures/bsp-project/app/src/main/scala/app/Main.scala \
  6 53
```

This checks initialization, document opening, diagnostics, hover, definition and shutdown. Positions are zero-based.
