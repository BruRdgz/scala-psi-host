/**
 * Owns an imported workspace, its source buffers and its build connection.
 *
 * Sources stay registered when editor tabs close. Positions use zero-based lines and UTF-16 columns throughout
 * this API; edits update in-memory documents rather than saving files to disk. Source requests require a path
 * registered by the build and fail if a partial import has left the session unavailable.
 *
 * Callers serialize document operations and imports, as the LSP documents executor does. `isSource` and
 * `problems` support concurrent diagnostic work: their guard excludes partial host updates. `compileBuild` may
 * run alongside document operations; BSP compilation, imports and closure are serialized within the session.
 * `snapshot` provides counts from the last completed import without waiting for the current one.
 *
 * Close the session to release its BSP connection, formatter and document compiler. The shared host and its
 * mounted libraries remain owned by the process.
 *
 * @param host process-scoped PSI host in which this workspace's modules and sources are registered
